                <h3>Introduction To League Of Legends</h3>
                <p><img src="images/moba/league stuff/download.jpg" width="78" height="48"></p>
<p>League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. It is a free-to-play game. It was first announced on October 7, 2008, and released on October 27, 2009.</p>
				
                <h3>Gameplay Of League Of Legends</h3>
                <p><img src="images/moba/league stuff/nexus.jpg" width="300" height="100">    <img src="images/moba/league stuff/rift.jpg" width="300" height="100"></p>
                <p>League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena where players take control of a character called a champion, and are matched with and against other players in teams. Players meet up usually in "lanes", and gain levels from killing the opposing team's Champions controlled by players and Minions that regularly spawn and attack the other team. The player earns a small amount of gold passively, but gets more by killing minions, towers that guard the lanes, and neutral monsters. With this gold, they can buy items to strengthen their champion for the duration of the game. On the classic Summoners Rift map, the game is ended by destroying the last structure on the map, the enemies' "Nexus". </p> 
                
                <h3>Player Persona</h3>
                <p><img src="images/moba/league stuff/player.png" width="78" height="57"></p>
                <p>The player is personified as a "Summoner" and acts as the persistent element in the game, to be used to track statistics and scores for each player. Summoners gain experience points and "Influence Points" (in-game currency) for each battle they participate in. Experience points lead to persistent level gains for the Summoner, up to a maximum level of 30. The benefit of gaining levels is unlocking Mastery Points and Rune Page slots (below) which improve the overall strength of the Summoner's chosen champion in-game. The Summoner can also choose two summoner spells. These spells significantly impact gameplay, and have a high cooldown while costing no mana. All spells can be improved by masteries, which are developed in a skill tree. Masteries are perks that affect gameplay, structured in a skill tree. All of the masteries are passive effects, although some can be activated. They are grouped into Offensive, Defensive, and Utility categories. Masteries can be re-distributed every match.</p>
                
                <h3>Advance Information</h3>
                <p>Similar to masteries, runes affect gameplay in minor ways. Runes are categorized into Marks (offensive), Seals (defensive), Glyphs (magic) and Quintessences (utility). Runes must be unlocked in the Store and it is possible to have more than one copy of a rune. Summoners must arrange their runes in the Runebook to benefit from them. The Runebook has limited number of slots for each rune type, but more rune pages can be purchased from either Influence Points or Riot Points. Combining two equal-tier runes produces a random rune of the same tier, while combining 5 equal-tier runes produces a higher-tier rune.</p>
