                    <p>Battlefield 4 is a first-person shooter video game developed by EA Digital Illusions CE (DICE) and published by Electronic Arts. It is a sequel to 2011's Battlefield 3. It was released on October 29, 2013 in North America, October 31, 2013 in Australia, November 1, 2013 in Europe and New Zealand and November 7, 2013 in Japan for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One.</p>
                    <h4 id="Gameplay">Gameplay</h4>
                    <p>Battlefield 4 features several changes compared to its predecessor. The game's heads-up display is much the same, composed of two compact rectangles. The lower left-hand corner features a mini-map and compass for navigation, and a simplified objective notice above it; the lower right includes a compact ammo counter and health meter. The mini-map, as well as the main game screen, shows symbols marking three kinds of entities: blue for allies, green for squadmates, and red/orange for enemies.</p>

                    </table>
                    <p>Players can use dual-scoped weapons, including weapons with different firing modes (e.g. single shots, automatic fire). They can "spot" targets—marking their positions to the player's squad— in the single player campaign (a first in the Battlefield franchise) as well as in multiplayer, allowing teammates to either suppress or eliminate them. Bullet-dropping-system has become much more enhanced allowing players to precise their aiming with the environment. In addition, players will have more survival capabilities, such as countering melee attacks from the front while standing or crouching, shooting with their sidearm while swimming, and diving underwater to avoid enemy detection. The single-player campaign will see the player using vehicles to quickly traverse mini-sandbox-style levels. The campaign also features three separate endings based on the player’s choice in the final mission.</p>
                    <p>The singleplayer features assignments that require specific actions and unlock weapons for use in multiplayer upon completion. Collectible Weapons return along with the introduction of Collectible Dog Tags which can be used in multiplayer. Weapon crates are found throughout all levels, allowing players to obtain ammo and switch weapons. While crates hold default weapons, collectible weapons may be used whenever they are acquired and level specific weapons may be used once a specific mission assignment has been completed by obtaining enough points in a level.</p>

                    </table>
                    <p>Battlefield's multiplayer contains 3 playable factions; U.S., China and Russia and up to 64 players on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. A newly reintroduced "Commander Mode", last seen in Battlefield 2142, gives one player an RTS-like view of the entire map and the ability to give orders to teammates. Also, the Commander can observe the battle through the eyes of the players on the battlefield, deploying vehicle and weapon drops to "keep the war machine going", and order in missile strikes and such on hostile targets (as long as at least one friendly player can see the target). A spectator mode is included, enabling players to spectate others in first or third person, as well as use a free camera to pan around the map from any angle.</p>

It can also function as a more offensive class with ability to swap out the revive kit for a grenade launcher.</p>

The primary weapon is a carbine rifle, with a variety of unlocks available, ranging from shotguns to sub machine guns.</p>

In Battlefield 3, the Support class is broadened with the ability top use lighter weapons and assault rifles like the M4, as well as C4 explosives.</p>
