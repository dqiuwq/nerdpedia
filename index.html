                    <p class="paragraph">Every Pokémon game you've ever played has lied to you. They've assembled a web of deceit wrapped around the idea that the series is, in some way, about being friends with your Pokémon. The best trainers, they've said over and over and over again, are the ones who are the kindest to their monsters. The ones who trust their monsters. The ones who care about their monsters' feelings. You know that's never been true; you've known all along. But with Pokémon X and Y, the developer has finally lived up to the 15-years of lip service. It has finally addressed the thesis of the franchise, making a game where your bond with your Pokémon actually, truly matters..... <a href="console-review.html" style="float:right">Continue Reading</a></p>

                    <p class="paragraph">There is a distinct difference between "Job" and "Role." In order to have a well functioning team throughout a game it is important for players to know their role and their job, as well as the differences between the two.
<br />
<br />
A Job is the category that your character will play throughout the match, from beginning to end. Examples include AP Caster, Tank, Melee DPS, etc. If your selected character can fill one of multiple positions depending on your build it is important to let your team know which one you plan on filling. If your team expects you to be the tank/offtank/Basic Meat shield, and you choose to build AP caster instead, your team is left with a gaping hole in their composition which they may not be aware of until too late.
<br />
<br />
A Role is a category that your character will play at this moment. It is usually temporary or evolving throughout the match. Jungler is a role that is filled at the beginning and usually during champion select, but by mid game it no longer serves a purpose, so that character transitions to something else. Heavy AP characters tend to fill the role of "Carry" early to late-mid game. But the earlier they start dominating the more likely the other team will build a lot of Magic Resist and completely neutralize them, at which point another character must step up and be the carry (usually giving the opportunity for the AD caster to shine and take over "carry" duties.)

There are more roles and jobs than there are players on a 5 man team, so no team can have them all. What is important for a successful team is to fill as many as possible, be willing to quickly adjust roles on the fly, and be aware of what was not brought this match and adjust game-style or item builds for it.<br /><a href="leagueroles.html" style="float:right">Read More</a></p>
