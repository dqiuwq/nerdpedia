                        	<p style="font-size:14px">The main character of the game. Lightning is a tough young woman previously associated with the Cocoon Guardian Corps. She is given the task to fulfill her "focus" after becoming a l'Cie. The two yellow stripes on the her left shoulder symbolize her Rank in the Guardian Corps. Lightning has long light pink hair and is 178 cm (70.1 inches) tall. <br /><br />
               For her design, character designer Tetsuya Nomura was asked to create someone like a "female version of Cloud Strife from Final Fantasy VII." During development, he described her as "not very feminine." Lightning wields a gunblade, that can transform into a sword or gun on the fly.<br /><br /> Lightning has buttons on her finger tip and thumb which can be used to manipulate gravity. She controls Odin, a giant god-like warrior who turns into a horse in Gestalt mode. She is voiced by Ali Hillis in the English version and by Maaya Sakamoto in the Japanese version. Her personality evolves throughout the game. She's seen at the beginning of the game as a cold, distant character, not caring for any of the other members of her party. As the story progresses, she opens up and becomes more likable especially with Hope Estheim, whom she protects and teaches how to fight.</p>
